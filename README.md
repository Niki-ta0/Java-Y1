# Java-Y1 â€“ Teacher Management System

This is a Java project I created during my first year of university as part of my Programming coursework (CS4001NI).  
The goal was to build a simple desktop application that helps manage information about Teachers, Lecturers, and Tutors.

## What does it do?

This application lets users:

- Add details about Lecturers and Tutors (like name, address, department, etc.)
- Display all saved information
- Grade assignments for Lecturers
- Set salaries and performance ratings for Tutors
- Remove Tutors from the system
- Clear input fields easily

All the data is handled in the background using **ArrayLists**, and the program uses **Java Swing** to create a user interface.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Java** (Programming language)
- **BlueJ** (To write and run the code)
- **Swing** (For creating the buttons, input fields, and layout)
- **MS Word** and **Draw.io** (For writing documentation and drawing diagrams)

## What I Learned

While doing this project, I learned:

- How to create a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** in Java
- How to use **Object-Oriented Programming** (with classes and inheritance)
- How to handle user input and show helpful messages
- How to catch and fix common errors (like wrong num
